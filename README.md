# Dotfiles Repository

This repository contains my personal dotfiles--focusing on a `tmux` configuration that enhances the command-line interface by enabling features such as mouse support, `Vi`-like key bindings, and aesthetic enhancements through themes.


- **`.tmux.conf`**: `Tmux` configuration file with enhanced keybindings and theme settings.

## Features

- **Mouse Support**: Enable interaction with tmux panes and windows using the mouse.
- **Custom Prefix**: Change the global prefix key to `Control-Space` to start command sequences, making it more intuitive.
- **`Vim`-style Navigation**: Navigate between `tmux` panes using `Ctrl-h/j/k/l`, mimicking `Vim`'s navigation to enhance usability and ergonomics.
- **`Vi` Keybindings**: Set command mode keys to `Vi` for consistency with `Vim` usage for selecting the active window.
- **Theme Support**: Includes configuration for the `rose-pine` theme and setup for other `tmux` themes via `TPM` (`Tmux Plugin Manager`).
